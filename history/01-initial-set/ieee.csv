A Graph Transformation based Approach for Runtime Constrained Evolution of Service-Oriented Architectures,Y. Zhao; D. Ma; M. Liu; C. Hu; Y. Huang,NA; NA; NA; NA; NA,"2009 17th Euromicro International Conference on Parallel, Distributed and Network-based Processing",,2009,,,203,209,"Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) is a new form of distributed software architecture. SOA promotes loose coupling, services distribution, dynamicity and agility. Services involved in an SOA are remote and autonomous services, the SOA designer can not control them and unpredictable behavior can occur. This makes the SO different from other architectures for its special architecture elements and its dynamic and evolving structure. How to model this specific architecture and support service-oriented development is unimportant research field in service-oriented software engineering community.

A Testbed for Evaluating Anomaly Detection Monitors through Fault Injection,A. Ceccarelli; T. Zoppi; A. Bondavalli; F. Duchi; G. Vella,NA; NA; NA; NA; NA,2014 IEEE 17th International Symposium on Object/Component/Service-Oriented Real-Time Distributed Computing,,2014,,,358,365,"Amongst the features of Service Oriented Architectures (SOAs), their flexibility, dynamicity, and scalability make them particularly attractive for adoption in the ICT infrastructure of organizations. Such features come at the cost of improved difficulty in monitoring the SOA for error detection: i) faults may manifest themselves differently due to services and SOA evolution, and ii) interactions between a service and its monitors may need reconfiguration at each service update. This calls for monitoring solutions that operate at different layers than the application layer (services layer). In this paper we present our ongoing work towards the definition of a monitoring framework for SOAs and services, which relies on anomaly detection performed at the Application Server (AS) and the Operating System (OS) layers to identify events whose manifestation or effect is not adequately described a-priori. Specifically the paper introduces the key concepts of our work and presents the case study built to exercise and set-up our monitor.

Towards Dynamic Evolution of Service Choreographies,W. Song; G. Zhang; Y. Zou; Q. Yang; X. Ma,NA; NA; NA; NA; NA,2012 IEEE Asia-Pacific Services Computing Conference,,2012,,,225,232,"To stay on the cutting edge, Web services ought to adapt themselves to the evolving business requirements and the changing environments. For a long-running service choreography, its member services may need to evolve even at run-time. However, inconsistencies or spurious results (e.g., unspecified receptions and deadlocks) may occur if these services evolve dynamically in an uncoordinated manner. To cope with this problem, we propose an approach that supports the dynamic evolution of choreographies. In our approach, two mechanisms are proposed to make sure that the choreography evolution can be conducted in an orderly fashion. First, an evolution protocol is proposed to support dynamic co-evolution of the member services in a choreography. Second, the proposed approach restricts choreography changes to one single service only if the relevant partner services can evolve simultaneously. A typical purchase order application is used to motivate our proposal and illustrate the viability of our approach.",,978-1-4673-4825,10.1109/APSCC.2012.40,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6478220,dynamic co-evolution;service choreography;instance migration;evolution protocol,Protocols;Business;Service-oriented architecture;Petri nets;Firing;Heuristic algorithms;Complexity theory,order processing;protocols;service-oriented architecture;software maintenance;Web services,service choreographies dynamic evolution;Web services;business requirements;run-time;evolution protocol;dynamic co-evolution;member services;choreography change restriction;partner services;purchase order application;service composition;service-oriented architecture;SOA,,3,23,,,,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences
Interactive Ontology Evolution Management Using Mutli-agent System: A Proposal for Sustainability of Semantic Interoperability in SOA,S. Slimani; S. Baïna; K. Baïna,NA; NA; NA,2011 IEEE 20th International Workshops on Enabling Technologies: Infrastructure for Collaborative Enterprises,,2011,,,41,46,"This paper discusses a new approach towards ontology evolution management framework and relates it to the sustainability of semantic interoperability in SOA. Indeed, when the semantic representation of the service evolves, the interpretation of queries may change. Thus, it's often challenging to evaluate the results of the query. Sources of this problem include the lack of support for semantic evolution management in ontology-based service oriented systems, and the static nature of the mappings between ontologies in this environment. To address these issues, we have developed P<sup>2</sup>OManager, an interactive tool for ontology evolution management. This system allows the users to automatically create an ontology agent manager. This agent manages evolution on both ontology and mappings and communicates with other ontology agents to take them aware of all changes which may affect exchanges with their services. Examples illustrate how P<sup>2</sup>OManager can provide valuable support for ontology evolution management, when specific changes are provided.",1524-4547;1524-4547,978-1-4577-0134-4978-0-7695-4410,10.1109/WETICE.2011.15,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5990020,semantic web service;ontology evolution;multi-agent system,Ontologies;Semantics;Service oriented architecture;Receivers;Proposals;Syntactics;OWL,interactive systems;ontologies (artificial intelligence);open systems;service-oriented architecture,interactive ontology evolution management;mutliagent system;semantic interoperability sustainability;SOA;ontology-based service oriented systems;P2OManager,,,12,,,,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences

Such features may include energy preservation system, or activity-recognition techniques.

Following the web services architectural model, a service provider may not be in full view of the service requestors consuming his offered services, hence a mechanism to support the existing service requestors in the event of changes made to a service, need to be put in place. This will help to reduce the full impact of unannounced service changes on the service requestors.

Major evolutions have happened beginning with basic architecture relying on initiated request by a client to a processing side referred to as the server. Such architectures were not enough to cope up with the fast ever-increasing number of requests and need to utilize network bandwidth. Mobile agents attempted to overcome such drawbacks but did cope up for so long with the growing technology platforms. Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) then evolved to be one of the most successful representations of the client-server architecture with an added business value that provides reusable and loosely coupled services. SOA did not meet customers and business expectations as it was still relying on monolithic systems. Resilience, scalability, fast software delivery and the use of fewer resources are highly desirable features. Microservices architecture came to fulfil those expectations of system development, yet it comes with many challenges.

Supporting Service-Oriented Design with Metrics,H. Hofmeister; G. Wirtz,NA; NA,2008 12th International IEEE Enterprise Distributed Object Computing Conference,,2008,,,191,200,"The service-oriented architectural style is widely perceived today. However, service orientation is a very general concept and its application in real-life situations is somewhat ambiguous. This is partially due to the fact that service-oriented principles are subject to interpretation rather than elements of the style.In this paper we propose a set of design metrics for service-oriented design. Based on an established metric for the coupling of component-based systems we introduce a complexity metric by the means of service coupling. We argue that service aggregators and the centralization of a system's control flow is appropriate to address a system's complexity. In order to approach an objective design that incorporates these principles, we introduce four metrics for the analysis of how a system handles its complexity with service-oriented means. Finally, we apply the presented metrics to an enterprise-scale real-life case study that we have conducted.",1541-7719,978-0-7695-3373,10.1109/EDOC.2008.13,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4634770,SOA;metrics;control centralization;service aggregation;modifiability,Couplings;Complexity theory;Service oriented architecture;Business;Organizations;Size measurement;Process control,software architecture;software metrics,service-oriented design;service-oriented architectural style;component-based systems;complexity metric;service coupling,,6,22,,,,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences

However after a product is introduced in the market, its successful growth against the competitors depends critically on the company's ability to rapidly improve and extend its product in response to customer feedback. These changes must be reflected accordingly in the web service without injecting any disputes. Hence an effective web service Change Management with appropriate change measures is very essential. This paper focuses on such change measures for an effective change management.",,978-1-4799-3672-4978-1-4799-3671,10.1109/ICCCS.2014.7068197,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7068197,Web Service Change Management;Change Measures;Service Oriented Architecture;Web Services,Business;Credit cards;Service-oriented architecture;Standards;Computers;Calendars,business data processing;information systems;management of change;service-oriented architecture;Web services;XML,Web service change management;enterprise information systems;service oriented architectures;SOAs;business process automation;IT system integration;Web service standards;service invocations;software systems;interoperable machine-to-machine interaction;XML-based open standards;customer feedback,,,10,,,,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences

Cohesion Metrics for Predicting Maintainability of Service-Oriented Software,M. Perepletchikov; C. Ryan; K. Frampton,RMIT University; RMIT University; RMIT University,Seventh International Conference on Quality Software (QSIC 2007),,2007,,,328,335,"Although service-oriented computing (SOC) is a promising paradigm for developing enterprise software systems, existing research mostly assumes the existence of black box services with little attention given to the structural characteristics of the implementing software, potentially resulting in poor system maintainability. Whilst there has been some preliminary work examining coupling in a service-oriented context, there has to date been no such work on the structural property of cohesion. Consequently, this paper extends existing notions of cohesion in OO and procedural design in order to account for the unique characteristics of SOC, allowing the derivation of assumptions linking cohesion to the maintainability of service-oriented software. From these assumptions, a set of metrics are derived to quantify the degree of cohesion of service oriented design constructs.

SOA is a very effective response to the problems faced by companies in terms of reusability, interoperability and reduce coupling between systems that implement their information systems. To exploit these advantages many organizations have decided to evolve their legacy systems (LS) towards this architecture. Migration to SOA has become one of the most important modernizations technic of LS. It helps organizations, on the one hand, to reuse their existing LS by giving them a new life, and also to enjoy the benefits of service-based systems.

As any other software artifact, such service compositions are subject to an unescapable evolution (Lehman's first law of software evolution). Either for answering new user requirements, for adapting, for correcting or for enhancing the provided functionality or quality, an architect has to conduct some evolutions on the design of these artifacts. In this paper, we present a method which aims at helping software architects of Web service orchestrations in processing an evolution of quality requirements. This method introduces a template for describing quality evolution ""intents"". It then analyzes these intents and assists the architects in answering them by proposing some patterns. We consider in our work the postulate stating that quality can be implemented through patterns, which are specified with checkable/process able languages. Besides this, the method that we propose simulates the application of these patterns and notifies the architect with its consequences on the other implemented qualities.",,978-1-4799-3412,10.1109/WICSA.2014.35,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6827111,SOA Pattern;Quality Attribute;BPEL;Architecture Evolution,Catalogs;Computer architecture;Service-oriented architecture;Documentation,formal specification;service-oriented architecture;software maintenance;software quality;Web services,pattern-based approach;distributed service oriented software architectures;Web service orchestration;software artifact;service compositions;Lehman first law of software evolution;user requirements;quality requirements;quality evolution intents,,1,20,,,,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences

The proposal is the move from homogeneous monolithic architectures to heterogeneous micro-architectures, to allow for application evolution. The focus is on growing legacy applications that will evolve to remain healthy. Cellular regeneration concepts are used to show that applications should always be regenerating, like cells living in an organism, to become resilient to events that cause disturbance and damage. Understanding regeneration can give insights into growing computational systems that are more resilient. A definition for micro-architectures and comparisons on how such an architecture differs from typical monolithic architectures are given. Concepts to allow applications to adapt to new and changing business and scientific computational needs are designed.

Nowadays, software development is notably influenced by service-oriented architectures (SOAs), in which the quality of software systems is determined by the quality of the involved services and their actual composition. Despite the efforts on improving their individual quality, adding or replacing services in an evolving system can introduce failures, thus compromising the satisfaction of the system's functional and extra-functional requirements. These failures erode the trust in the SOA vision. Thus, a key issue for the industrial adoption of SOA is providing service providers, integrators, and consumers the means to build confidence that services behave according to the contracted quality conditions. In this paper we present a first version of PA SCA NI, a framework for specifying and executing test specifications for service-oriented systems. From a test specification, PA SCA NI generates a configuration of testing services compliant with the Service Component Architecture (SCA) specification, which can be composed to integrate different testing strategies, being these tests traceable in an automated way.

Understanding the Runtime Topology of Service-Oriented Systems,T. Espinha; A. Zaidman; H. Gross,NA; NA; NA,2012 19th Working Conference on Reverse Engineering,,2012,,,187,196,"Through their dynamic and loosely coupled nature, service-oriented systems are ideal for realizing runtime evolvable systems. However, runtime evolution demands proper understanding of the configuration of service-oriented software systems over time. In order to keep system disturbance as low as possible while replacing existing services with their newer versions, engineers require an adequate illustration of how the connections and dependencies of services change in the running system. That way, they can identify the most appropriate point in the service-oriented systems' operation time for maintenance. In this paper, we make use of the runtime topology (i.e. the configuration of a distributed, dynamically compos able software system which describes available services and how they depend and interact with each other) to help software engineers understand service-oriented systems, and we describe a tool, Serviz, that visualizes how services are activated, and how much they interact over time. A user study demonstrates to which extent the runtime topology can support the analysis and understanding of service-oriented software systems.",2375-5369;1095-1350,978-0-7695-4891-3978-1-4673-4536,10.1109/WCRE.2012.28,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6385114,service-oriented systems;SOA;maintenance;reengineering;reverse engineering;monitoring;runtime topology;service-oriented systems topology;topology;software topology,Runtime;Topology;Maintenance engineering;Software systems;Service oriented architecture,service-oriented architecture;software maintenance;software tools;topology,runtime topology;service-oriented software systems;runtime evolvable systems;system disturbance;operation time;Serviz tool;service oriented architecture;SOA,,4,19,,,,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences
A Framework for Managing Dynamic Service-Oriented Component Architectures,W. Rudametkin; L. Touseau; D. Donsez; F. Exertier,NA; NA; NA; NA,2010 IEEE Asia-Pacific Services Computing Conference,,2010,,,43,50,"Software development is moving from monolithic to modular, dynamically composable applications. Modularity and dynamicity are the basis for software evolution since they provide the means of adapting and updating an application. Currently, service-oriented component models are one of the most advanced technologies for creating dynamic applications. These component models, which inherit concepts from both component-based software engineering and service oriented computing, provide a programming model that both supports and encourages dynamic reconfigurations. Although reconfigurations are possible, it is still difficult to manage a dynamic application's architecture, especially in highly dynamic environments. In this paper, we provide an overview of the benefits of service oriented component models and the main concepts used in their implementations. We provide a model that reifies important concepts and can be used to manage the application's architecture and its dynamic reconfigurations. Finally we propose a generic framework that allows for the creation of specialized architecture managers, capable of both monitoring and controlling dynamic service-oriented component applications.",,978-1-4244-9396,10.1109/APSCC.2010.99,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5708552,Service oriented components;dynamic reconfiguration;adaptive systems,Computer architecture;Adaptation model;Object oriented modeling;System-on-a-chip;Computational modeling;Software;Dynamic scheduling,object-oriented programming;service-oriented architecture;software development management;software engineering,dynamic service-oriented component architectures;software development;dynamically composable applications;modularity;dynamicity;software evolution;service-oriented component models;component-based software engineering;service oriented computing;programming model;dynamic reconfigurations;highly dynamic environments;service oriented component models;specialized architecture managers;dynamic service-oriented component applications,,1,26,,,,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences
Linking legacy services to the business process model,H. M. Sneed; S. Schedl; S. H. Sneed,"Anecon GmbH, Vienna, Austria; Metasonic AG, Pfaffenhofen an der Ilm, Germany; Metasonic AG, Pfaffenhofen an der Ilm, Germany",2012 IEEE 6th International Workshop on the Maintenance and Evolution of Service-Oriented and Cloud-Based Systems (MESOCA),,2012,,,17,26,The purpose of the work described here is to support the reuse of existing software systems in a SOA environment by linking a description of existing programs to the overlying business processes. It is one thing to technically wrap the legacy code. It is another matter to connect the code interface definition to the business processes. The SoftLink tool is under development to bridge that gap between the business model and the code reality. The crux of the solution is to identify the entry points to the application system and their parameters and to link them to the events in the business process via a WSDL interface. The method is illustrated here on a legacy COBOL application for processing customer orders. From that code interfaces to the events within the subject-oriented business process model are created via a semi-automated transformation. Future development will focus on linking Java and .Net systems as well. This will provide a better basis for the maintenance of SOA systems and allow impact analysis to traverse the border between model and code.,2326-6910;2326-6937,978-1-4673-3001-5978-1-4673-3002,10.1109/MESOCA.2012.6392601,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6392601,Reverse engineering;legacy code reuse;business process modeling;maintaining SOA systems;impact analysis;COBOL;BPM;BPMN;S-BPM;SOA,Business;Unified modeling language;Object oriented modeling;Analytical models;Joining processes;Service oriented architecture;Maintenance engineering,business data processing;COBOL;Java;service-oriented architecture;software maintenance;Web services;XML,software system;SOA;legacy code;code interface definition;SoftLink tool;code reality;WSDL interface;COBOL;customer order processing;code interface;subject-oriented business process model;semiautomated transformation;Java;.Net systems;legacy service,,1,28,,,,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences

Before, grown, monolithic, software has been pushed to the limits of maintainability and scalability. The microservice architecture approach utilizes the service oriented architecture together with best practices and recent developments in software virtualization to overcome those issues. One monolithic application is split up into a set of distributed services. Those are strongly decoupled to enable high maintainability and scalability. In this case an application is split up in a top down manner. In the internet of things, applications need to be put together from a set of small and independent services. Thus, creating value added services would require to freely combine services of different vendors to fully make use of the IoT's heterogeneity. Even though the direction is different, many of the requirements in microservices are similar to those of the internet of things. This paper investigates patterns and best practices that are used in the microservices approach and how they can be used in the internet of things.

To progress on the successful route to a SOA engineering with minimal design decisions losses, we propose a model-to-model transformation that preserves the architectural alignment between the business process and their supporting service implementation infrastructure.

The method allows to faithfully assess, upon request, the reliability of a MSA-based application under a scarce testing budget, at any time when it is in operation, and exploit field data about microservice usage and failing/successful demands.

A Platform-Independent Mechanism for Deployment of Business Processes Using Abstract Services,A. Mos; T. Jacquin,NA; NA,2013 17th IEEE International Enterprise Distributed Object Computing Conference Workshops,,2013,,,71,78,"This paper deals with the problem of efficiently deploying business processes in service oriented environments with the purpose of enhancing operational agility and improving governance. Today's solutions rely on early coupling between the business process layer and the underlying service oriented architecture layer and this constrains evolution in either of the two layers to the ability of the other layer to adapt. The presented approach leverages abstract architectural mappings that indirectly connect business process activities with service-based assets. It consists of a deployment mechanism that is capable of taking these mappings and generating fully executable artifacts for a variety of runtime platforms. The deployment mechanism is encapsulated in a self-contained entity that is instantiated and executed each time a business process needs to be deployed. This entity contains all the necessary data for the deployment, while ensuring complete accountability of operations. This approach promotes late binding of processes to the underlying SOA and it has the potential to significantly increase the speed of implementing changes in business operations while ensuring long-term sustainability.

Although such dynamicity makes SOA a promising architectural style, it prevents organizations from having complete knowledge of the SOA and of its (possibly untrusted) services. This constitutes an important restriction to the applicability of the SOA architectural style to real-time and (business-)critical services, consequently requiring new solutions to automatically discover the services that compose the SOA and to assess their behavior during execution. In this paper we present an approach for services discovery in dynamic SOAs. The discovery algorithm we propose merges information provided by different services providers and is implemented in a testing service that becomes an intrinsic part of the SOA. The practical case study presented shows the effectiveness of the solution.",,978-1-4577-0303-4978-0-7695-4377,10.1109/ISORCW.2011.23,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5753522,service oriented architecture;system evolution;self-organization;discovery;testing,Service oriented architecture;Testing;Monitoring;Real time systems;Robustness;Business;Context,program testing;software architecture;user interfaces,service discovery approach;service oriented architectures;distributed services;SOA architectural style;real-time systems;business-critical systems;services providers,,5,22,,,,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences
Service Oriented Steganography - A Novel Approach towards Autonomic Secured Distributed Heterogeneous Environments,P. Lalbakhsh; S. Ravanbakhsh; M. N. Fesharaki; N.

In this approach the related works on steganography and its anatomy is semantically studied and broken down into some independent services which are allocated on a network infrastructure. According to the underlying service oriented architecture (SOA), these services are able to communicate to each other or the other system services through a common language to dynamically form the desired compositions. This structure not only distributes the overall load of the process, it also considers some important system attributes such as reusability, simplicity, outsourcing, maintainability, flexibility and availability. Because of the open structure of the system, varieties of steganography algorithms can be supported for varieties of secrets, according to an evaluation strategy which is also considered as a service on the network.

Service Discovery Using a Semantic Algorithm in a SOA Modernization Process from Legacy Web Applications,E. Sosa-Sánchez; P. J. Clemente; M. Sánchez-Cabrera; J. M. Conejero; R. Rodríguez-Echeverría; F. Sánchez-Figueroa,NA; NA; NA; NA; NA; NA,2014 IEEE World Congress on Services,,2014,,,470,477,"Service-oriented architectures (SOA) offer a suitable solution to manage the continuous changes in companies business processes. SOA facilitates the alignment of business process with underlying system services. There is a high percentage of Legacy Web Applications (LWA) developed by software factories that were implemented by using Model-View Controller (MVC) frameworks and without considering SOA in their development process. In this context, many companies are performing a modernization of their systems to be adapted to SOA. However, this migration is usually carried out ad-hoc by means of not reusable and error-prone manual processes. Additionally, these migration processes are often performed at a low abstraction level, close to code, hindering reusability and maintainability of the obtained systems. In this paper a Model-Driven systematic and semi-automatic approach to modernize legacy web applications to SOA is presented. The approach eases the reutilization of the process at different domains, since the underlying services of the LWA are identified and generated from model-driven techniques, but also of the new generated system since these new services may be offered as an interoperable service layer. Although the paper completely introduces the approach, it mainly focuses on the semantic process defined to discover services of the LWA that may be later associated (aligned) to the company business processes.",2378-3818,978-1-4799-5069-0978-1-4799-5068,10.1109/SERVICES.2014.90,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6903309,Reverse engineering;web applications;service- oriented architecture;semantic algorithms;service discovery;model-driven engineering,Semantics;Service-oriented architecture;Companies;Unified modeling language;Dictionaries,business data processing;Internet;open systems;service-oriented architecture;software maintenance;software reusability,service discovery;semantic algorithm;SOA modernization process;legacy Web applications;service-oriented architectures;business processes;LWA;model-view controller;MVC;software factories;error-prone manual processes;system reusability;system maintainability;model-driven techniques;interoperable service layer,,1,17,,,,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences

Any application can access an SOA network for interaction as long as it complies with the corresponding standards. A centralized SOA architecture can also be regarded as a part of SOA.

With the previous as a basis, this paper discusses the function and implementation of SOA in the distributed architecture, proposes an SOA-based distributed multi-layer architecture and an application integration frame realized via J2EE.

We tackle the problem of making this lifecycle explicit, providing development time and runtime support for evolutionary changes in such systems. SBSs are modeled as integrated ecosystems consisting of four conceptual layers (or phases): design, implementation, deployment, and runtime. Our work is driven by the notion that identifying the right changes (monitoring) and effecting of these changes (adaptation) usually takes place individually on each layer. While considering changes on a single layer (e.g., runtime adaptation) is often sufficient, some cases require systematic escalation to adjacent layers. We present a generic lifecycle model that provides an abstracted view of the problem domain and can be mapped to concrete artifacts on each individual layer.

A Constraint Mechanism for Dynamic Evolution of Service Oriented Systems,B. Zhao; Y. Zhao; D. Ma,NA; NA; NA,2012 IEEE 15th International Symposium on Object/Component/Service-Oriented Real-Time Distributed Computing,,2012,,,103,110,"Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) is a new form of distributed software architecture, which promotes loose-coupling and coarse-granularity. It deploys, composes and calls application components in a distributed way on Internet. The dynamics of Internet environment poses challenge to dynamic service oriented system. The distributive Internet environment requires SOA to be more distributive and self-adaptive, and choreography emphasizes the collaboration between services. Also, more flexible and dynamic software architecture is demanded for service-based software. A strong constraint mechanism which describes architectural limitation of run-time system is needed to make sure the system runs correctly. The main contribution of this paper is a graph grammar based modeling and verification approach for constrained evolution of service-oriented system. System specification described by SOA pattern and structural constraints and their satisfaction checking algorithms are proposed. We have implemented a constrained evolution verification tool that allow us to model runtime SOA, constraints and verify consistency at design-time. Further, a constraint decomposition method towards member services is given for the non-central executable SOA.

Investigating the Change-Proneness of Service Patterns and Antipatterns,F. Palma; L. An; F. Khomh; N. Moha; Y. Guéhéneuc,NA; NA; NA; NA; NA,2014 IEEE 7th International Conference on Service-Oriented Computing and Applications,,2014,,,1,8,"Like any other software systems, service-based systems (SBSs) evolve frequently to accommodate new user requirements. This evolution may degrade their design and implementation and may cause the introduction of common bad practice solutions -- antipatterns -- in opposition to patterns which are good solutions to common recurring design problems. We believe that the degradation of the design of SBSs does not only affect the clients of the SBSs but also the maintenance and evolution of the SBSs themselves. This paper presents the results of an empirical study that aimed to quantify the impact of service patterns and antipatterns on the maintenance and evolution of SBSs. We measure the maintenance effort of a service implementation in terms of the number of changes and the size of changes (i.e., Code churns) performed by developers to maintain and evolve the service, two effort metrics that have been widely used in software engineering studies. Using data collected from the evolutionary history of the SBS FraSCAti, we investigate if (1) services involved in patterns require less maintenance effort, (2) services detected as antipatterns require more maintenance effort than other services, and (3) if some particular service antipatterns are more change-prone than others. Results show that (1) services involved in patterns require less maintenance effort, but not at statistically significant level, (2) services detected as antipatterns require significantly more maintenance effort than non-antipattern services, and (3) services detected as God Component, Multi Service, and Service Chain antipatterns are more change-prone (i.e., Require more maintenance effort) than the services involved in other antipatterns.

The MSA style is an approach to developing a single application as a suite of small services, each running in its own process and communicating with lightweight mechanisms. Although the set of MSA principles aim for high degree of flexibility, modularity and evolution, adopting, operating and maintaining microservice architectures in practice is challenging and time consuming. This paper reports on a PhD research project addressing three different challenges concerning MSA: (i) the identification of the key properties of microservice architectures, (ii) the identification and investigation on a description language for designing and analyzing architectures, (iii) the identification of the factors that impact the process of migrating existing applications towards MSA. The initial contributions of this project are: (i) a systematic mapping study on architecting microservices performed in order to understand the state of the research and the possible gaps in the area, (ii) an approach for architecture recovery of microservice-based systems named MicroART, and (iii) the implementation of the MicroART first prototype.",,978-1-5090-4793-2978-1-5090-4794,10.1109/ICSAW.2017.65,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7958492,Microservices;Software Architecture;Systematic Mapping Study;Architectural Language,Computer architecture;Unified modeling language;Analytical models;Tools;Service-oriented architecture,cloud computing;service-oriented architecture,service oriented architecture;cloud computing;Web 2.0;microservice architecture;cloud infrastructures;MSA principles;description language;systematic mapping study;architecture recovery;MicroART,,1,43,,,,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences

The concept of service is an evolution of these paradigms to emphasize loose-coupling in order to develop software as composition of reusable, loosely coupled units of software. The service-oriented computing (SOC) is working to principle the service towards the realization of service-oriented software (SOS). Meanwhile, Web services use the Internet and standards such as XML to challenge the realization of SOC. Yet, we still need a comprehensive Web services architecture that captures the properties of all the layers of the Web services stack, from wrapping, describing, deploying, registering, managing, monitoring, and discovering basic software units to recursively composing software. This work proposes a metadata for such architecture that represents the Web services with respect to four perspectives: service specification, service deployment, service as wrapper of legacy systems, and service as a unit of composition of software supporting business processes.

However, nonfunctional quality of service (QoS) attributes may evolve due to the changes of network conditions and locations of the service users. Some real services may update their QoS properties on-the-fly, others may turn to unavailable. Thus, addressing the problem of uninformed QoS evolution of Web services has become a significant research issue. This paper proposes a dynamic evolution framework of Web services, which uses the Collaborative Filtering (CF) to predict the QoS values and enables the evolution of Web services. In this framework, the QoS values of current users can be predicted using the past QoS data of similar users. There is no extra Web services invocation.

IPv6 is a critical protocol in VNET6 and Virtual networks are built above network layer of IPv6 protocol stack. Virtualization in VNET6 aims to be a scale-out architecture using multiple entities to build a logical entity. This paper presents the details of virtual consolidation, virtual partition and virtual service. VNET6 supports different services and has many advantages such as service flexibility, simple manageability and high reliability. Giving example considerations of optimizing video experience, VNET6 is adaptive to video service with high bandwidth and low tendency and improves quality of experiences to users.",,978-1-4673-4724-2978-0-7695-4910,10.1109/CSC.2012.13,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6414475,Network architecture;service-oriented architecture (SOA);IPv6;virtualization;service cloud,Computer architecture;Virtualization;Protocols;Reliability;Service oriented architecture;Bandwidth;Scalability,computer network reliability;Internet;IP networks;quality of experience;service-oriented architecture;transport protocols;virtualisation,VNET6;SOA;IPv4 address;IANA;APNIC;Internet continued growth;service specified requirements;reliable services;IPv6 virtual network architecture;flexible services;incremental network evolution;service-oriented network architecture;virtualization technologies;network layer;IPv6 protocol stack;virtual partition;virtual services;quality of experiences,,1,22,,,,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences

WSDarwin: A Framework for the Support of Web Service Evolution,M. Fokaefs,NA,2014 IEEE International Conference on Software Maintenance and Evolution,,2014,,,668,668,"Service-oriented architectures have emerged as a popular development paradigm for modular, extendible distributed systems, relying on interoperable components. However, their evolution is a challenging problem, due to the fact that their constituent parts typically reside outside a single entity's domain of ownership and control. In my thesis, I have developed WSDarwin, a framework to support the evolution of service systems. WSDarwin posits a novel conceptual model of the technical and economic relationships between service providers and clients, based on which, a game-theoretic method determines the best evolution decision for them as distinct economic players and for the ecosystem as a whole. Furthermore, WSDarwin provides a complete toolkit for client adaptation (including service-interface differencing, client-proxy adaptation and client unit testing), to simplify the client's software evolution task in response to service changes.",1063-6773,978-1-4799-6146,10.1109/ICSME.2014.123,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6976167,,Web services;Ecosystems;Mathematical model;Accuracy;Usability;Companies;Conferences,client-server systems;game theory;open systems;program testing;service-oriented architecture;Web services,client software evolution task;client unit testing;client-proxy adaptation;service-interface differencing;client adaptation;economic player;evolution decision;game-theoretic method;service provider;economic relationship;technical relationship;conceptual model;service system;interoperable component;distributed system;service-oriented architecture;Web service evolution;WSDarwin,,,,,,,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences

The results indicate that using explicit and systematic techniques has benefits for maintainability. The more sophisticated the applied methods the more satisfied participants were with the maintainability of their software while no link to a hindrance in productivity could be established.

Requirements Engineering for Adaptive Service Based Applications,N. A. Qureshi; A.

Engineering such applications significantly challenges the role of requirements engineering (RE). Usually, RE is carried out at the outset of the whole development process, but in the context of SBA, RE activities are also needed at run-time thus enabling a seamless SBA evolution.

For a domain like Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) this is particularly true because most SOA solution designs are based on modification of existing assets that change over time. However, today there exists only limited work that reasons about this evolution. In this work we present our framework for traceability of evolving architectures that we apply for SOA solution design. Our design approach is based on an iterative process that utilizes a set of solution patterns to guide architects in the SOA solution design. Our approach utilizes historical data about pattern enablement and uses that to guide architects in selecting the right patterns. To ensure that the right patterns are used, we use a template matching approach that enforces conformance by allowing only the right set of artifacts to be composed together.

From Software as a good to software as a service: Preparing the evolution of software products into the cloud,L. O. Arrieta,"TECNALIA, San Sebastián, Spain",2012 IEEE 6th International Workshop on the Maintenance and Evolution of Service-Oriented and Cloud-Based Systems (MESOCA),,2012,,,58,59,"Summary form only given. The speed of change in Internet Technologies continues to be impressive and the current “Future Internet” based society increasingly relies on software at all levels. Nevertheless, software systems continue to suffer from aging symptoms caused by the inherent factors of the software modernization process: inevitable; unpredictable; costly; difficult; time- and resource-consuming; poorly supported by tools, techniques or formalisms; poorly understood and maintained; undervalued in traditional software development processes, etc. Furthermore, current technological and business innovations (such as Cloud Computing and Software as a Service (SaaS) concepts) are changing the way in which software is designed, developed, tested, delivered and consumed. All this means that new requirements, never seen before in software development, have to be faced (scalability, multi-tenancy support, usage monitoring, security, SLA compliance, etc.). These challenges are even greater when adapting previously developed software to this new landscape. Different approaches (reverse engineering, ADM, or service-oriented-architecture modernization) have to be analyzed depending on the source language, architecture, target market or available resources. As a result, the complete software life cycle, from requirements to runtime and delivery, has to be re-adapted to the new technological and business conditions, needs and challenges, thus increasing the need of advanced means to support software evolution and adaptation as a key value for the next-generation service-based software modernization. One particular example of complex system modernization is the exposure of legacy systems as SaaS. Model-driven techniques have been used for several years to cope with the challenge of transformation of legacy systems as SaaS. Regardless of the positive features of these techniques, for legacy systems there are many challenges such as are the availability of architectural models describing the system (typically unavailable for legacy systems), the ability to transform the original system into new ones compatible with targeted infrastructures and frameworks, and the support for adaptive deployment. All these features are particular relevant when deploying legacy applications as SaaS on the Web, for instance using different Cloud offerings. Desirable solutions are those that can automate the transformation of existing legacy systems that require being transformed into modern ones exposed as services (SaaS) compatible with modern technology frameworks. This keynote will present the challenges and needs, as well as the results obtained so far in this novel architecture and business model based on the cloud.",2326-6910;2326-6937,978-1-4673-3001-5978-1-4673-3002,10.1109/MESOCA.2012.6392595,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6392595,,Aging;Business;Cloud computing;Europe;Conferences,cloud computing;innovation management;reverse engineering;service-oriented architecture;software development management;software reliability,software as a service;software products;Internet technology;future Internet;software systems;software modernization process;software development processes;technological innovation;business innovation;cloud computing;SaaS concepts;reverse engineering;ADM;service-oriented-architecture modernization;software life cycle;software evolution;software adaptation;next-generation service-based software modernization;complex system modernization;legacy systems;model-driven techniques;architectural models;targeted infrastructures;adaptive deployment;legacy applications;modern technology frameworks;business model,,4,,,,,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences

Humans have a lot to do with why software is expensive, and they contribute to its cost in at least three significant areas: the maintenance and evolution of existing software, the run-time monitoring and configuration of executing software, and errors made during data entry and system configuration tasks. Software engineers seek to mitigate these costs by minimizing or removing expensive human participation in these areas where possible by adopting software and hardware approaches aimed at doing so. In this paper, we describe a commercial software engineering project where code reuse, service-oriented architecture, and self-autonomic approaches were employed to extend the legacy enterprise system of a multi-channel vendor of musical equipment.

Automatic Reference Architecture Conformance Checking for SOA-Based Software Systems,R. Weinreich; G. Buchgeher,NA; NA,2014 IEEE/IFIP Conference on Software Architecture,,2014,,,95,104,"Company-wide reference architectures are an important means for standardization and reuse. Standardization is enforced through reference architecture conformance checking. Manual conformance checking is too time- and resource-intensive to be performed continuously for the various systems that are part of a SOA. We present an approach for automatic reference architecture conformance checking of SOA-based software systems. Reference architectures are defined based on rules consisting of roles and of constraints on roles and role relationships. By mapping the roles to the elements of a software architecture representation, reference architecture specifications are reusable for different software systems.

SOA migration case studies and lessons learned,P. Bhallamudi; S. Tilley,"Department of Computer Sciences, Florida Institute of Technology, Melbourne, USA; Department of Computer Sciences, Florida Institute of Technology, Melbourne, USA",2011 IEEE International Systems Conference,,2011,,,123,128,"Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) is a way of designing, developing, deploying, and managing enterprise systems where business needs and technical solutions are closely aligned. SOA offers a number of potential benefits, such as cost-efficiency and agility. To exploit the benefits that SOA offers, several organizations are adopting a services model for leveraging their existing legacy systems. Migration to SOA can give new life to the existing legacy, but if not done correctly the migration can also lead to failure. There are several factors for this, such as technology selection, migration approach, type of legacy system, and SOA governance. One way to learn how to achieve success and avoid failure is through a thorough analysis of existing work in this field. This paper reports on a study that analyzed existing SOA migration projects to learn from them the factors that influence the success or failure of their efforts. A mechanism called the Evolution Process Framework for SOA was used to structure the analysis. Three SOA migration case studies and one experience report were analyzed. Lessons learned from each study are summarized, with crosscutting issues distilled from across all four studies presented. One of the most important lessons learned is the significance of well-defined policies and procedures for defining, publishing, and maintaining services.",,978-1-4244-9493-4978-1-4244-9494-1978-1-4244-9492,10.1109/SYSCON.2011.5929124,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5929124,SOA;Migration;Case study;Lessons Learned,Service oriented architecture;Semiconductor optical amplifiers;Organizations;Testing;Standards;Security,evolutionary computation;failure analysis;learning (artificial intelligence);service-oriented architecture;software maintenance;software reliability,SOA;lessons learning;service-oriented architecture;enterprise system management;services model;migration approach;failure analysis;evolution process framework,,4,31,,,,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences

In recent years, the Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) has become one of the most popular agile software development processes, and frequently used in microservices development. The key to success of BDD is the executable acceptance tests that describe the expected behavior of a feature and its acceptance criteria in the form of scenarios using simple and business people readable syntax.

Service antipatterns may degrade the quality of design and may hinder the future maintenance and evolution of SBSs. The detection of service antipatterns is important to improve the design quality of SBSs and to ease their maintenance. A better understanding of service antipatterns is a must prerequisite to perform their detection. This paper presents a taxonomy of service antipatterns in Web services and SCA (Service Component Architecture), the two common SBSs implementation technologies. The presented taxonomy will facilitate engineers their understanding on service antipatterns. Other substantial benefits of the presented taxonomy include: (1) assisting in the specification and detection of service antipatterns, (2) revealing the relationships among various groups of service antipatterns, (3) grouping together antipatterns that are fundamentally related, and (4) providing an overview of various system-level design problems ensemble.",,978-1-4673-6920,10.1109/PPAP.2015.7076848,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7076848,Antipatterns;Taxonomy;Service-based systems,Taxonomy;Service-oriented architecture;Time factors;Maintenance engineering;Component architectures;Quality of service,formal specification;service-oriented architecture;Web services,service antipattern taxonomy;service-based system antipatterns;SBS antipatterns;design patterns;user requirements;execution contexts;SBS evolution;SBS maintenance;design quality improvement;Web services;SCA;service component architecture;SBS implementation technologies;service antipattern detection;service antipattern specification;system-level design problem ensemble,,,19,,,,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences

However concerns have been raised about the comprehensibility and maintainability of SOA composite applications. Integrating and deploying SOA applications requires artifacts in a variety of web-based languages (WSDL, XSD, BPEL, etc.) often produced by code-generation tools. It becomes difficult for a human to discover and understand the dependencies between these artifacts in an existing system. In this paper, we describe ongoing research on using search techniques to facilitate SOA maintenance by allowing users to query collections of artifacts making up a SOA composite application. The main focus in this paper is a case study using our prototype search tool SOAMiner to identify a set of abstractions that extract useful and critical information for maintainers, thereby bridging the heterogeneity of SOA artifacts while opportunistically exploiting their structure. Results of the study indicate that the highest priority abstractions for SOA are datatype summaries, service invocation (calling) relationships, and data usage relationships.",1550-4441,978-1-4577-0700-1978-1-4577-0699,10.1109/WSE.2011.6081819,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6081819,Services Oriented Architecture;SOA;Web Services;Evolution;Maintenance;Program Comprehension;Search,Service oriented architecture;Semiconductor optical amplifiers;Maintenance engineering;XML;Search problems,program compilers;service-oriented architecture;software maintenance;Web services,intelligent search support;Web service evolution;service oriented architecture;SOA composite application;Web-based language;code-generation tool;SOA maintenance;SOAMiner search tool,,2,15,,,,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences

In this new scenario, the educational environments, despite having many benefits and facilities with regard to teaching and learning, have problems and challenges that need to be addressed. One of the important aspects to be investigated concerns the establishment and adoption of architectural patterns. In fact, most of these environments are built in an isolated form, having their own architectures and structures, which may negatively impact the ability of standardization and support of architectural definition. The main goal of this paper is to investigate and define a service-oriented reference architecture for m-learning environments. The proposed architecture, named Ref-mLearning, aims to contribute to the evolution, reuse, and interoperability of such environments, enabling an increase in quality and cost reduction during their development, due to the use of features provided by service-oriented architecture.

Sneed,"SoRing Kft., Budapest, Hungary",2015 IEEE 9th International Symposium on the Maintenance and Evolution of Service-Oriented and Cloud-Based Environments (MESOCA),,2015,,,1,6,This presentation discusses a strategy for migrating to a service-oriented architecture. The starting point is legacy code in a procedural or object-oriented language. The result is a set of web services that can be accessed in a private or public cloud. The technique used is to cut out selected portions of code and to wrap them behind a service interface. The code itself can be left in the original language. The service interface is in WSDL. The speaker describes how to go about selecting code for reuse and how to extract that code from its current environment. Case studies are given for the languages COBOL and Java. The presentation then goes on to describe how to test the services using a web service testing tool which generates artificial requests from the service interface definition and validates the responses against the assertions provided by the tester.,2326-6937;2326-6910,978-1-4673-7935-9978-1-4673-7934,10.1109/MESOCA.2015.7328119,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7328119,SoA Migration;Legacy Code;Service extraction;Service wrapping;Interface generation;WSDL;Web-Service testing;Test automation;Test coverage measurement,Unified modeling language;Business;Web services;Object oriented modeling;Wrapping;Testing,cloud computing;Java;service-oriented architecture;software maintenance;Web services,SoA;service-oriented architecture;legacy code;procedural language;object-oriented language;private cloud;public cloud;WSDL;COBOL;Java;Web service testing tool;service interface definition,,,12,,,,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences

It is a new software architecture, which is flexible to evolution, continuously reactive and adaptive to multiple targets. Internetware is able to perceive dynamic changes from internal or external environment, and then do some static adjustment and dynamic evolution according to functional and nonfunctional index to keep a high customer satisfaction. Concept of SOA (Service-Oriented Architecture) is a business-IT-aligned approach in which applications rely on available services to facilitate business processes. Service requestor can flexibility invoke reusable services provided by service provider. However, if your business change, your application consisting of any services need to add, replace, delete any services. Therefore, you have to modify the configuration file or code. Why we don't apply the mature evolution and self-adaption in Internetware to SOA. Then, changes perceived can drive the changes of application based on SOA and our work is to guide these changes in high-level or business-level rather than work in coding-level. Therefore, this paper presents a CCO model binded the SCA(Service Component Architecture) to provide interfaces, which can be invoked by the evolution system or human being's guidance.

SOAR: An Extended Model-Based Reasoning for Diagnosing Faults in Service-Oriented Architecture,S. D. Kim; S. H. Chang,NA; NA,2009 Congress on Services - I,,2009,,,54,61,"Service-oriented architecture (SOA) is a cost effective approach to building enterprise applications. SOA reveals non-conventional characteristics of heterogeneity, grid-like distribution, evolvability, and limited visibility. Hence, services management presents non-conventional challenges. Especially, fault diagnosis at runtime is challenging due to the SOA features. Model-based reasoning (MBR) is a formal approach to diagnosing faults, which is based on predicate calculus and term resolution. In this paper, we present SOAR (service-oriented abductive reasoning) which extends the basic MBR to diagnose faults in various SOA components. SOAR provides an enhanced inference capability with state-based and QoS-based reasoning in addition to the basic setting/observation-based reasoning. We propose concrete schemes to formally represent system description, normal behavior, fault model and observations, and reasoning methods to diagnose faults and to determine their causes. In addition, we present a case study of applying SOAR to show how it is applied in practice and how the diagnosis can be conducted in autonomous way.",2378-3818,978-0-7695-3708,10.1109/SERVICES-I.2009.57,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5190756,service oriented architecture;Diagnosis;Model-based Reasoning,Inference mechanisms;Service oriented architecture;Fault diagnosis;Computer science;Costs;Runtime;Concrete;Engines;Buildings;Application software,business data processing;fault diagnosis;inference mechanisms;Web services,SOAR-extended model-based reasoning;fault diagnosis;service-oriented architecture;enterprise application;service-oriented abductive reasoning;QoS-based reasoning;inference capability,,1,10,,,,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences

DKEM: A Distributed Knowledge Based Evolution Model for Service Ecosystem,X. Wang; Z. Feng; S. Chen; K.

Semantics of services from different venders may be described by distributed domain ontologies. Distributed knowledge brings difficulty to competition and cooperation among services, and hampers the evolution of a service ecosystem. In this paper, we propose a distributed knowledge based evolution model (DKEM) to promote competition and cooperation among services from different venders. DKEM considers stability as key factor in competition, and a stability evaluation model is designed to compute stability of services, venders, and service-based processes according to service invocation histories. Based on the evaluation model, two evolution patterns are given, and they can automatically explore new and more stable cooperation among services by means of runtime self-adaption mechanism.

Evolution in enterprise service oriented architectures (ESOAs) presents significant challenges to managing risks associated with performance and scalability. Four of the field-trials involved the construction and use of models to specifically address performance risks related to the evolution of service architectures, resulting from, and to explore changes in: architecture, services, deployment, resources, and loads. This paper first presents some unifying observations on the architectural commonalities of evolving enterprise services, discusses the performance and scalability challenges, and describes some common approaches to addressing them.

Delatte,Alcatel Vacuum Technology; Claude Bernard University; Claude Bernard University; Alcatel Vacuum Technology,IT Professional,,2007,9,3,19,24,"The notion of ""service"" has spurred major evolutions for both information systems and the Web. A software application is no longer considered a monolithic component; it can be divided into services that are smaller components defined by their function and accessible through well-defined interfaces and protocols. As a result, IT actors are using service-oriented architectures (SOAs) to remodel the information systems of many companies while the Web is increasingly becoming a programmable place. In both domains, developers build composite client applications to consume these services. Even boundaries between enterprise services and Internet services are vanishing. Some companies, such as Strikelron provide enterprise services that were previously always hosted internally - like customer relationship management solutions. As a consequence, companies now have the technologies required to bring their business online. With Web services, private business processes can be exposed to partners through public composite Web applications. When new projects emerge, companies need guidance to properly handle such work. In this context, we aim to provide companies solutions - through a methodology, an architecture, and technical choices - that will help them solve generic problems such as security and application conception",1520-9202;1941-045X,,10.1109/MITP.2007.55,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4216104,Service-oriented computing;SOA;Web services;business systems;Web applications.,Web services;Companies;Service oriented architecture;Information systems;Web server;Middleware;Access protocols;Network servers;Web and internet services;Application software,customer relationship management;information systems;Web services,service-oriented computing;business systems;information systems;enterprise services;Internet services;customer relationship management;Web services,,2,,,,,,,IEEE,IEEE Journals & Magazines
A model-driven process to modernize legacy web applications based on service oriented architectures,E. Sosa; P. J. Clemente; J. M. Conejero; R.

Service Oriented Architectures (SOA) come to the scene to give a solution to these continuous changes providing a way to align business rules with underlying services. This is why there is a current trend to migrate legacy web applications to new SOAs. However, this migration requires the identification, publication and orchestration of the underlying service layer. These are complex tasks usually carried out ad hoc by manually defining and developing the service layer and its coordination. Moreover, these processes are usually performed at a low abstraction level, close to code, hindering reusability and maintainability of the obtained system. Model-Driven techniques aim at tackling the complexity of these processes since models drive the migration from a higher abstraction level. In that sense, this paper presents a Model-Driven systematic and semiautomatic process to modernize legacy WAs to SOAs. It also relies on techniques that are used to identify and classify the services offered by the different WAs of the organization. On the one hand, conceptual representations of the WAs and the service oriented architecture are obtained. On the other hand, the underlying services of the web applications are generated from models so that they may be offered as an interoperable service layer, which may be aligned with the company business rules and orchestrated with external services.",1550-4441,978-1-4799-1610-8978-1-4799-1608,10.1109/WSE.2013.6642418,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6642418,reverse engineering;web applications;service-oriented architecture;model transformations,Service-oriented architecture;Reverse engineering;Companies;Adaptation models;Computer architecture,Internet;service-oriented architecture,model-driven process;legacy Web applications;service oriented architectures;WA;business rules;SOA;low abstraction level;model-driven techniques;higher abstraction level;semiautomatic process;interoperable service layer,,3,20,,,,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences
Application Configuration Repository for Adaptive Service-Based Systems: Overcoming Challenges in an Evolutionary Online Advertising Environment,M. E. B. Broinizi; D. Mutti; J. E. Ferreira,NA; NA; NA,2014 IEEE International Conference on Web Services,,2014,,,670,677,"Software engineering has greatly evolved in recent years. Today applications are deployed on heterogeneous distributed infra-structure from mobile devices to cloud computing. Service-oriented architectures, such as SOA and REST Web Services, have been widely used to efficiently design high-availability, scalable and reliable systems for dynamic business environments based on a distributed infra-structure. Despite the improvements these architectures have made to enhance the evolvability of systems, there are some challenges that still need to be overcome. More concretely, service-based systems and development teams are constantly under pressure from business stakeholders who continuously increase their demands for changes in systems. This paper describes a configuration-based approach that can empower adaptive mechanisms in order to overcome this challenge. It presents a solution based on a centralized application configuration repository service specially designed as a RESTful web service API to provide the benefits of configuration, such as adaptability, to high-availability, scalable and loosely coupled systems, allowing them to respond quickly to changes. The solution was successfully implemented in an evolutionary online advertising system used by the largest Brazilian web-portal, responsible for processing 5 billion ad requests per month. It allowed the design of a self-adaptive advertisement ranking mechanism that continuously evolves the system configuration, without human supervision. The adoption of this solution was responsible for a drastic increase in the amount of changes applied in this advertising environment. It also greatly reduced the time from conceiving a new change to having it working in the system. Moreover, the solution is available as open source and it has also being used by several other service-based systems.",,978-1-4799-5054-6978-1-4799-5053,10.1109/ICWS.2014.98,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6928958,configuration;adaptive systems;evolutionary algorithms;online advertising;RESTful,Advertising;Libraries;Java;Service-oriented architecture;Computer architecture,advertising data processing;service-oriented architecture;Web services,application configuration repository;adaptive service-based systems;evolutionary online advertising environment;software engineering;SOA;service-oriented architecture;system evolvability;business stakeholders;configuration-based approach;RESTful Web service;self-adaptive advertisement ranking mechanism;Brazilian Web portal,,1,15,,,,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences

The evolution of such service infrastructures, in response to an increased workload on the system or a changing resource allocation, is often tedious and expensive, due to weak evolvability support of its service portfolio. This underpins the need for services to be designed with high evolvability characteristics. Semantic Web technologies have been anticipated as a basis for the required Web service evolution. JSON-LD is a prominent Semantic Web technology used in combination with ontologies, developed with the Web Ontology Language (OWL), to face the evolutionary challenges. Our applied research investigates common Web service tasks, automated using above technologies. It is explained, that this enables the creation of evolutionary building blocks.

The platform is structured as a service-oriented architecture composed of a federation of coordinated web entities and service providers which play distinct roles and interact within a trusted environment. Furthermore, the proposed architecture enables service providers to use a specific middleware to exploit the computing resources they need to provide their protection services.

Continuous evolution could easily deteriorate the design and reduce the Quality of Service (QoS) of SBSs and may result in poor design solutions, commonly known as SOA antipatterns. SOA antipatterns lead to a reduced maintainability and reusability of SBSs. It is therefore important to first detect and then remove them. However, techniques for SOA antipattern detection are still in their infancy, and there are hardly any tools for their automatic detection. In this paper, we propose a new and innovative approach for SOA antipattern detection called SOMAD (Service Oriented Mining for Antipattern Detection) which is an evolution of the previously published SODA (Service Oriented Detection For Antpatterns) tool. SOMAD improves SOA antipattern detection by mining execution traces: It detects strong associations between sequences of service/method calls and further filters them using a suite of dedicated metrics. We first present the underlying association mining model and introduce the SBS-oriented rule metrics. We then describe a validating application of SOMAD to two independently developed SBSs. A comparison of our new tool with SODA reveals superiority of the former: Its precision is better by a margin ranging from 2.6% to 16.67% while the recall remains optimal at 100% and the speed is significantly reduces (2.5+ times on the same test subjects).",1095-1350;2375-5369,978-1-4799-2931,10.1109/WCRE.2013.6671307,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6671307,SOA Antipatterns;Mining Execution Traces;Sequential Association Rules;Service Oriented Architecture,Service-oriented architecture;Measurement;Association rules;Couplings;Scattering;Detection algorithms,data mining;quality of service;service-oriented architecture,SOA antipattern detection;service based systems;execution trace mining;SBS-oriented rule metrics;software systems;quality of service;QoS;SOMAD;service oriented mining for antipattern detection;SODA;service oriented detection for antipattern tool;service-method calls sequences;association mining model,,2,37,,,,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences

As more enterprises choose to migrate to Service-oriented Architecture (SOA), the Web services and their stakeholders are facing a more distributed and dynamic environment. The evolution ofWeb services consumer requirements and the competitive pressures encourage web service providers to always make efforts to improve and update services by publishing continuously new versions. In this context, each participant in SOA will be involved in the issue of the Web Service evolution. Before reacting to this evolution, an impact analysis must be done to estimate the sideeffect caused by the changes that occur during the evolution.

It defines how to use services to achieve business goals, and allows interoperability with multiple customers within different business domains. The growing use of SOA has increased research interest on how to improve the reuse of services. Hence, managing services variability was introduced by many approaches as a new leading edge concept for improving reuse. Indeed, variability refers to the characteristic of a system to adapt, specialize and configure itself with the context of use. Several proposals have been made in this respect. However, none of these seem to deal with the evolution of these configurable services. In service oriented systems, the evolution of services is usually introduced by the evolution of the associated business process. Therefore, if a configurable process model (CPM for short) should evolve in reaction to changing business needs, the associated configurable services (CS for short) are also impacted by this change. In our previous work, we proposed a complete methodology for managing evolution in configurable process models.

Towards Consistency Management for a Business-Driven Development of SOA,K. Dahman; F. Charoy; C.

With a Model Driven Engineering where the business process models drive the supporting service component architectures, less effort is gone into the Business/IT alignment during the initial development activities, and the IT developers can rapidly proceed with the SOA implementation. However, the difference between the design principles of the emerging domain-specific languages imposes serious challenges in the following re-design phases. Moreover, enabling evolutions on the business process models while keeping them synchronized with the underlying software architecture models is of high relevance to the key elements of any Business Driven Development (BDD). Given a business process update, this paper introduces an incremental model transformation approach that propagates this update to the related service component configurations. It, therefore, supports the change propagation among heterogenous domain-specific languages, e.g., the BPMN and the SCA. As a major contribution, our approach makes model transformation more tractable to reconfigure system architecture without disrupting its structural consistency.

During compilation, cross-cutting functionalities in the second set are woven to the functionalities modeled in the first set. By introducing AOP in SOA, the quality attributes such as re-usability, extendibility and maintainability can be improved. The objective of this paper is to perform an empirical investigation by quantitatively measuring the effect of introducing Aspect Orientation (AO) in SOA by developing with multiple versions of a given application. An AO based SOA application (University Automation System) for automating the functionalities of a typical University with multiple versions has been developed as an experimental test bed. An equivalent set of versions without introducing aspectization are also developed in parallel.

This was done by integrating a hydrodynamic model and a disaster assessment model into geographical information system (ArcGIS Server 9.3) as a web service using ArcObjects in ArcGIS and Java. Storm flood was simulated by hydrodynamic model at the Yangtze estuary. Population, house area, important units and submerge water depth were considered as impact factors to build storm-tide evaluation index system, with which the influence of storm flood was acquired by quantitative evaluation model using fuzzy method. Geographic information system was investigated to show storm flood process and disaster assessment results in two and three dimension map. According to the assessment results, Optimization Algorithm was employed to calculate afflicted population assigned to available refugee settlements. And optimal retreat routes were provided by Shortest Path Algorithm according to the traffic information of Shanghai. To meet the business demands, the two algorithms were published as web services and integrated into DSS through web services composition(WSC).

Since years a lot of new business opportunities appear using the potential of services computing, Internet of Things, mobile systems, big data with analytics, cloud computing, collaboration networks, and decision support. Biological metaphors of living and adaptable ecosystems provide the logical foundation for self-optimizing and resilient run-time environments for intelligent business services and adaptable distributed information systems with service-oriented enterprise architectures. This has a strong impact for architecting digital services and products following both a value-oriented and a service perspective. The change from a closed-world modeling world to a more flexible open-world composition and evolution of enterprise architectures defines the moving context for adaptable and high distributed systems, which are essential to enable the digital transformation. The present research paper investigates the evolution of Enterprise Architecture considering new defined value-oriented mappings between digital strategies, digital business models and an improved digital enterprise architecture.",2325-6605;2325-6583,978-1-5386-4141-5978-1-5386-4142,10.1109/EDOCW.2018.00023,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8536109,"Digital Transformation, Value Perspective, Digital Strategy and Service Modeling, Digital Enterprise Composition Architecture, Architectural Evolution",Computer architecture;Business;Internet of Things;Cloud computing;Big Data;Software;Adaptation models,Big Data;business data processing;cloud computing;groupware;information systems;service-oriented architecture,digital services;adaptable distributed systems;digital transformation;digital strategies;digital business models;Internet of Things;mobile services;services computing;mobile systems;intelligent business services;adaptable distributed information systems;service-oriented enterprise architectures;IT systems;microservices;big data;cloud computing;collaboration networks;biological metaphors;closed-world modeling;flexible open-world composition;digital enterprise architecture;value-oriented mappings,,,56,,,,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences

Adaptability requirements are even more evident when monitoring deals with Service Level Agreements (SLA) established among the choreography participants.

Thus also the monitoring infrastructure must keep track of the continuous evolution of the underlying environment, and adapt itself accordingly.

An efficient way of managing faults in SOA is to apply principles of autonomic computing (AC), of which process is specified in MAPE. The first two phases of MAPE are to monitor target systems and diagnose faults to determine underlying cause. The other two phases are to plan healing/actuation methods and to execute them. Devising methods to remedy service faults which can run in autonomous manner is a hard problem, mainly due to the remoteness and the limited visibility and controllability.

The dispersion compensation of the 10-GHz HML-SOAFL pulse with a 100-m-long dispersion compensation fiber is performed to shorten the pulsewidth from 29 to 2.9 ps with a compression factor of 10, and a time bandwidth product (TBP) of 0.5. The soliton compression with a 10-m-long single-mode fiber is employed to deliver the amplified 10-GHz HML-SOAFL soliton pulse with a peak power of 38.2 W and a pulsewidth of 1.6 ps, while the spectrum is broadened from 1.4 to 2.3 nm with a TBP of 0.45. To monitor the dynamic chirp evolution, a second-harmonic generation frequency-resolved optical gating (SHG-FROG) is used to retrieve the amplitude and phase contour profile of the HML-SOAFL. The phase fitting result distinguishes the linear chirp from the nonlinear chirp associated with the HML-SOAFL pulse, which are 0.016 ps<sup>2</sup>and 0.002 ps<sup>3</sup>.

Modern IT tools offer solutions, but often target only individual system aspects such as modeling and simulation and rarely address the continuous evolution and changing requirements of such intralogistics systems. In this work, we approach distributed intralogistics systems as a system of systems and present a cloud-based engineering design process using microservices.

This new computing paradigm offers numerous advantages but also, poses significant challenges. Advantages are related to the flexibility service providers have on deploying virtual resources on as-needed-basis, providing thus opportunities for large scale computing capabilities, while limiting the total cost of ownership. However, these benefits come at the cost of the user partially losing control over the deployed resources and the cost managing platforms and applications that are now provisioned at an unprecedented rate and interaction complexity. In order to address the above challenges, a service management and service assurance framework is required, whereby policies should be formally modeled, and consequently be verified against runtime system behavior models.

Like other software, a service has to undergo maintenance during its lifetime to cope with changes in requirements and environment or to handle errors. Unfortunately certain changes of a service, especially service interface changes, can have effects on other parts of the system which use the service. It is therefore useful to determine service stability so that a service designer can determine how well the service-oriented system evolves while preserving the design. This paper proposes a stability measurement model for service-oriented systems. The model is based on logical stability of a Web service which is measured by the degree of unchanged elements of the service interface during its evolution from one version to another. The paper considers stability between any pair of service and system versions as well as the overall stability of the service and system which involve several parallel versions. The knowledge of service stability can help the service designer during maintenance of the serviceoriented system since the new service version should be designed to preserve stability and cause as minimal impacts as possible. The service designer can also observe how stable the services and the whole system are over their lifetime when considering service reuse or planning service maintenance cost and effort.",,978-1-4673-8227-4978-1-4673-8226,10.1109/MySEC.2015.7475195,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7475195,stability;Web service;service-oriented system;measurement;software evolution,Web services;Stability criteria;Object oriented modeling;Measurement;Maintenance engineering,service-oriented architecture;software maintenance;software reusability;Web services,stability measurement model;service-oriented systems;service technology;Web service;software development;software maintenance;service interface;service stability;service reuse;planning service maintenance cost,,,10,,,,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences

However, to date, the impact of service cohesion on the analyzability subcharacteristic of maintainability has not been rigorously studied. Consequently, this paper extends existing notions of cohesion in the Procedural and OO paradigms in order to account for the unique characteristics of SOC, thereby supporting the derivation of design-level software metrics for objectively quantifying the degree of service cohesion. The metrics are theoretically validated, and an initial empirical evaluation using a small-scale controlled study suggests that the proposed metrics could help predict analyzability early in the Software Development Life Cycle. If future industrial studies confirm these findings, the practical applicability of such metrics is to support the development of service-oriented systems that can be analyzed, and thus maintained, more easily.

In this paper, we propose a structure of interoperable medical information system based on SOA (service-oriented architecture) and Web 2.0 under the framework of regional health information network. Various components are described in detail, including authentication, data access, and services management and so on. Services for medical information getting are registered and published by the system; users then access the system to search and fetch demanded services and value-added applications. All of the heterogeneous and distributed data and applications are converted to independent services according to international standards. As a result of the use of SOA, the system is levels clearly demarcated with good universality and maintainability.",,978-1-4244-3928-7978-1-4244-3930,10.1109/ITIME.2009.5236236,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5236236,,Medical information systems;Semiconductor optical amplifiers;Hospitals;Service oriented architecture;Web server;Medical services;Authentication;Biomedical informatics;Information systems;Health information management,health care;Internet;medical information systems;message authentication;software architecture,interoperable medical information system;healthcare information systems;service-oriented architecture;Web 2.0;regional health information network;authentication;data access;services management;demanded services;value-added applications;distributed data;international standards,,4,9,,,,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences
A Security Modeling Approach for Web-Service-Based Business Processes,M. Jensen; S. Feja,NA; NA,2009 16th Annual IEEE International Conference and Workshop on the Engineering of Computer Based Systems,,2009,,,340,347,"The rising need for security in SOA applications requires better support for management of non-functional properties in Web-based business processes. Here, the model-driven approach may provide valuable benefits in terms of maintainability and deployment. Apart from modeling the pure functionality of a process, the consideration of security properties at the level of a process model is a promising approach. In this work-in-progress paper we present an extension to the ARIS SOA architect that is capable of modeling security requirements as a separate security model view. Further we provide a transformation that automatically derives WS-security policy-conformant security policies from the process model, which in conjunction with the generated WS-BPEL processes and WSDL documents provides the ability to deploy and run the complete security-enhanced process based on Web service technology.",,978-0-7695-3602,10.1109/ECBS.2009.14,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4839262,security;SOA;security model;Web Services;views,Data security;Web services;Service oriented architecture;Computer security;Application software;Programming;Information security;Access control;Conferences;Computer science,business data processing;formal specification;object-oriented programming;security of data;software architecture;specification languages;Web services,security requirements modeling;Web service-based business process;SOA;nonfunctional property management;model-driven approach;conformant security policy;WS-BPEL process;WSDL document,,22,32,,,,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences
